    <h1 class="mone">Clint Eastwood</h1>
    <p class="cvb">Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor and film director. After achieving
        success in the
        Western TV series Rawhide, Eastwood rose to international fame with his role as the "Man with No Name" in Sergio
        Leone's Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the mid-1960s and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the
        five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others, have made Eastwood an enduring
        cultural icon of masculinity.[4][5] Elected in 1986, Eastwood served for two years as the mayor of
        Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.</p>
    <p class="mnb">Eastwood's greatest commercial successes are the adventure comedy Every Which Way but Loose (1978)
        and its action
        comedy sequel Any Which Way You Can (1980).[6] Other popular Eastwood films include the Westerns Hang 'Em High
        (1968), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and Pale Rider (1985), the action-war film Where Eagles Dare (1968), the
        prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979), the war film Heartbreak Ridge (1986), the action film In the Line of
        Fire (1993), and the romantic drama The Bridges of Madison County (1995). More recent works include Gran Torino
        (2008), The Mule (2018), and Cry Macho (2021). Since 1967, Eastwood's company Malpaso Productions has produced
        all but four of his American films.</p>
    <p class="vbn">An Academy Award nominee for Best Actor, Eastwood won Best Director and Best Picture for his Western
        film
        Unforgiven (1992) and his sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004). In addition to directing many of his own star
        vehicles, Eastwood has directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery drama Mystic River (2003)
        and the war film Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy Award nominations, as well as the
        legal thriller Juror #2 (2024). He also directed the biographical films Changeling (2008), Invictus (2009),
        American Sniper (2014), Sully (2016), and Richard Jewell (2019).</p>
    <p class="zxc">Eastwood's accolades include four Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, three CÃ©sar Awards, and
        an AFI Life
        Achievement Award. In 2000, he received the Italian Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion award, honoring his
        lifetime achievements. Bestowed two of France's highest civilian honors, he received the Commander of the Ordre
        des Arts et des Lettres in 1994, and the Legion of Honour in 2007.</p>
