    <center><p>Smile 2 is a 2024 American psychological supernatural horror film written and directed by Parker Finn. A sequel to Smile (2022), the film stars Naomi Scott as a pop star who begins to experience a series of increasingly disturbing events just as she is about to embark on tour. It also features Rosemarie DeWitt, Lukas Gage, Miles Gutierrez-Riley, Peter Jacobson, Ray Nicholson, Dylan Gelula, and Ra√∫l Castillo, with Kyle Gallner reprising his role from the first film. <br> 

        In March 2023, following the commercial success of Smile, Finn signed a first-look deal with Paramount Pictures to develop additional horror projects. In the following April, a sequel to Smile had entered pre-production, with Finn returning as writer and director. Principal photography took place in early 2024 in New York. <br>
        
        Smile 2 was released theatrically in the United States on October 18, 2024. Like its predecessor, the film received positive reviews from critics, with Scott receiving critical acclaim for her performance, and grossed $138.1 million worldwide. A sequel is in development. <br></p></center>
