            Life Is Beautiful (Italian: La vita è bella, Italian: [la ˈviːta ˈɛ bˈbɛlla]) is a 1997 Italian comedy-drama
            film directed by and starring Roberto Benigni, who co-wrote the film with Vincenzo Cerami. Benigni plays
            Guido Orefice, a Jewish Italian bookshop owner, who employs his imagination to shield his son from the
            horrors of internment in a Nazi concentration camp. The film was partially inspired by the book In the End,
            I Beat Hitler by Rubino Romeo Salmonì and by Benigni's father, who spent two years in the Bergen-Belsen
            concentration camp during World War II.
