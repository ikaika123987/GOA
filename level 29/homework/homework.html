    <h1>Animals</h1>
    <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]). With few
        exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce
        sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a
        clade, meaning that they arose from a single common ancestor. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been
        described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are
        vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animal body
        lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with
        each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as
        zoology, and the study of animal behaviour is known as ethology.</p>
